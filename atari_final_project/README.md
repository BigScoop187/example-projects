This is my final project from my Atari Platform Studies class. It is the result
of less than 2 weeks of work on this specific project and less than 1 month of 
learning about the 2600 architecture and coding in 2600 assembly.

To play, you'll just need to open the reginalds_revenge.bin file in the Stella 
2600 emulator. This can be downloaded at the link below:

Check out the reginalds_revenge_manual for how to play. The layout will look 
off because it was mean to be printed as a pamphlet like all other 2600 games 
had. The formatting is a bit off even for this though.
