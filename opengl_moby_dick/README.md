This is my combined 2nd, and 3rd project for my Intro to Computer Graphics
class. It requred 4 weeks of work total, but all of the models and animations
were completed in the first 2 weeks. It was created with OpenGL and C++.

To run the project, you'll need Visual Studio:
   - http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx
and then following these instructions to install glut, it's for VS2010, but
should be similar for 2013:

HOW TO INTERACT:

- Left and right arrow keys – change viewer’s azimuth by exactly ±10°
- Up and down arrow keys – change viewer’s elevation direction by exactly ±10°
- c or C – Change the viewer’s direction of movement so that it is in line with
viewing direction.  Note that viewer will not change elevation even if she is
looking upward, instead only the direction of travel on the ground is altered. 
- r or R – Reset viewer’s head to look straight ahead.
- w or W – Start or stop the viewer walking.  Toggle viewer’s motion.
