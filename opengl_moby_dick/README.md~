This is my combined 2nd, and 3rd project for my Intro to Computer Graphics
class. It requred 4 weeks of work total, but all of the models and animations
were completed in the first 2 weeks. It was created with OpenGL and C++.

To run the project, you'll need Visual Studio:

and then following these instructions to install glut, it's for VS2010, but
should be similar for 2013:
